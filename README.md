Facial emotion recognition is an important emerging research area in affective computing. In daily life, we express a large part of non-verbal communication through facial expressions, so facial emotion analysis is widely studied by researchers. Emotion recognition from facial images can be effectively applied to surveillance video analysis, depression treatment, patient monitoring, computer games, operator fatigue detection, and robotics. The accuracy of widely used artificial intelligence models in facial emotion recognition directly depends on the dataset used. In this research work, we present a new, improved, supplemented, and extended FaceEmocDS dataset and the testing process of previously trained popular models. In our study, ResNET50, VGGNet-19, and DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network models and ViT transformer models were retrained on the new FaceEmocDS dataset.
